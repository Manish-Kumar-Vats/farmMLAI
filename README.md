AI SOLUTION FOR FARMERS

OUR PROBLEM AND ITS SOLUTION

Farmers usually suffer a lot in our country due to low production of crops, easy damage of crops,
due to low rainfall rate and harsh climatic conditions. Moreover, they are often forced to sell their
crops in the market at lower margin rates than the actual ones.

“THE BASIC PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY LACK PROPER GUIDANCE ON
WHAT ARE THE BEST CONDITIONS SUITABLE TO GROW A CROP WHICH LEADS TO
FOOD INSECURITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.”

Our solution aims at developing a mobile application in which we will predict the future weather
and monsoon conditions, soil fertility, average rainfall, etc and hence based on our predictions we
will prescribe the best optimum alternative to help them increase their productivity of crops in the
form of regular alerts.

In case of any mishappening like natural calamities then our application will be having the capability
to generate public alerts to the news channels in the form of RSS feeds so that the govt. can act as
helping hand for the farmers. Also to resolve the problem of less profit margins, our application
aims at building a connected ecosystem where the farmers and vendors can directly interact and
regulate their production and deals to solve the problem of demand for crop.

TECHNOLOGY STACK TO BE USED

Technologies to be used in our application are as follows:

TensorFlow Lite( To train the models of our application for predictive and prescriptive analysis)

Android Studio(for application development)

Data Analytics

Artificial Intelligence(For extracting the features of soil)


USE CASES OF APPLICATION

The use cases involves the people who are basically going to use are application:-

Farmers:-Our application’s main users are our farmers who will be provided with real time
weather and climate conditions according to their native areas ,also they will be provided with soil
details of their area and on the basis of these predictions, the application will suggest them best crop
and the related practices that will help them manifold their productivity.

Wholesalers:-Apart from farmers our portal will allow wholesalers to register so that they can easily
deal with the farmers and hence carry on online daily rates.

Agriclulture Officials: Moreover this application also focuses on increasing the awareness among the
farmers by the frequent informative & interactive updates by the agriculture department.

News Channels: The alert with current real time location of the accident will be sent to the
concerned news channels through the RSS feeds.
