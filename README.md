Farmers usually suffer a lot in our country due to low production of crops, easy damage of crops, due to low rainfall rate and harsh climatic conditions. Moreover, they are often forced to sell their crops in the market at lower margin rates than the actual ones.  “THE BASIC PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY LACK PROPER GUIDANCE ON WHAT ARE THE BEST CONDITIONS SUITABLE TO GROW A CROP WHICH LEADS TO FOOD INSECURITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.”  Our solution aims at developing a mobile application in which we will predict the future weather and monsoon conditions, soil fertility, average rainfall, etc and hence based on our predictions we will prescribe the best optimum alternative to help them increase their productivity of crops in the form of regular alerts.  In case of any mishappening like natural calamities then our application will be having the capability to generate public alerts to the news channels in the form of RSS feeds so that the govt. can act as helping hand for the farmers. Also to resolve the problem of less profit margins, our application aims at building a connected ecosystem where the farmers and vendors can directly interact and regulate their production and deals to solve the problem of demand for crop.
